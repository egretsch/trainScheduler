## Problem

The point of this activity is to take in given information the frequency of her rivals as well as the beginning of when the train starts. Take the given information and modify it so it predicts occurrences and frequencies of train arrivals into the station using momenta JS.

## Instructions

Click the link to access app. Once on page fill in the lines based on the way they are given make sure you enter the starting time is military time. Also enter in all the various relevant data in the locations that are provided. Hit submit. And sear data with in the next predicted time for scheduled train.

## In-depth analysis of how app works

In this app the participant will input information into the related fields. Once they have taken the information and input into the fields the information will then be saved and sent to firebase. Then that information will be read by the document and show the next predicted time by using moment JS to do the math to help provide the predictive information for the next arrival time from the starting time of the train
